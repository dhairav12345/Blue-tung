    <p>Blue-tongued lizards, also known as blue-tongued skinks, are a genus of large skinks found primarily in Australia and Indonesia. They are easily recognizable by their bright blue tongues, which they display as a defense mechanism to scare off predators. These lizards are popular as companion animals due to their curious nature and gentle temperament. They play a valuable role in pest control, feeding on snails, caterpillars, and other garden pests. Blue-tongued lizards are typically docile and can be found in various habitats, including forests, grasslands, and suburban areas.</p>
